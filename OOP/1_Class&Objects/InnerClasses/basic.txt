Itâ€™s a powerful feature of Java that allows you to logically group classes that are only used in one place, 
helping with encapsulation and readability.


ðŸ”¸Types of Inner Classes in Java

| Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Member Inner Class**    | Non-static class defined directly inside another class.                                                                                    |
| **Static Nested Class**   | Static class inside another class. Doesnâ€™t need outer class instance.                                                                      |
| **Local Inner Class**     | Defined inside a method, constructor, or block.                                                                                            |
| **Anonymous Inner Class** | Class without a name, used for instantiating objects with certain "on-the-fly" behavior, usually used with interfaces or abstract classes. |




to call a method in inner class we need to create a obj for inner class

OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();
