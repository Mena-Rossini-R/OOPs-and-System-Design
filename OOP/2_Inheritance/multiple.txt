Multiple Inheritance - b extends to a1,a2

with classes it is not implemented - implemented using interfaces

why ?

it causes a DIAMOND PROBLEM 

       A
     /   \
    B     C
     \   /
       D


    Class B and C both inherit from A

    Class D inherits from both B and C

Now, if class A has a method like show(), 
and both B and C override it, 
then which version should D inherit?

Thatâ€™s the ambiguity (somthing which is not clear/ multiple meaning)
