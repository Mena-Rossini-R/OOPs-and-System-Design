Encapsulation is the process of bundling variables and methods together within a single unit (a class) 
and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

ðŸ’¡ Key Goals:

    Protect the data.
    Control access using access modifiers.
    Ensure objects maintain a valid state.


âœ… How Do We Achieve It?

    Make variables private.
    Provide public getters and setters to access/update them.

ðŸ§ª Benefits of Encapsulation:

    Protects data from unwanted changes.
    Makes maintenance easier.
    Adds control over data.
    Improves reusability and flexibility.


Improves security, modularity, and maintainability.


IMMUTABILITY can be acheived if PRIVATE FINAL keywords are used together


âœ… 4. Encapsulation â‰  Abstraction

    Encapsulation = how you protect data

    Abstraction = what you expose or hide


ðŸ”„ Encapsulation in Real Life

    Think of it like a medicine capsule â€“ you don't know what's inside (private), but you get the result by taking it (public method).

    Or like ATM: You use buttons (methods) without seeing how it talks to your bank (data).


"Encapsulation provides security by restricting direct access to data and enabling validation via public methods."
