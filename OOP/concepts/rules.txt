1) Only one public class per file is allowed

2) to use super() -> it should be in the first line, it should be only 

3) we can use super.methodName -> to access immediate parent method -> can be in any line and anywhere(in constructor/ methods)


Java constructor chaining rule : 
Before a subclass constructor runs, the parent constructor is automatically invoked.
