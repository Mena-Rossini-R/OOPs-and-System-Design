Here's a list of important built-in interfaces in Java you should know:
Interface	Package	Purpose / Use Case
Runnable	java.lang	Run code in a thread
Serializable	java.io	Save/transfer objects
Comparable<T>	java.lang	Sort objects by natural order
Comparator<T>	java.util	Custom sorting logic
Cloneable	java.lang	Allows cloning of objects
AutoCloseable	java.lang	Use in try-with-resources block
Iterable<T>	java.lang	Allows use in enhanced for-each loop
Callable<V>	java.util.concurrent	Like Runnable, but can return a result and throw exceptions
Closeable	java.io	For closing I/O resources (used in files, sockets)
Readable	java.lang	For reading character streams
Flushable	java.io	For flushing I/O streams
ðŸ”¸ Some Modern Java Interfaces (from Java 8+)
Interface	Package	Purpose
Function<T,R>	java.util.function	Functional interface for lambda with one argument and return value
Predicate<T>	java.util.function	Functional interface for testing conditions
Consumer<T>	java.util.function	Performs an action on a single input
Supplier<T>	java.util.function	Supplies results without input
BiFunction<T,U,R>	java.util.function	Like Function, but takes 2 arguments
These are mainly used in streams, lambdas, and functional programming.
