# 💻 Software Engineering Concepts - Core README

This repository serves as a quick reference and learning resource for the **fundamentals of software development**, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- SOLID Principles
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Design Patterns
- Software Architecture Models

## 📘 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

OOPs is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which contain data and methods.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:

| Concept          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Class**        | Blueprint or template for objects. |
| **Object**       | Instance of a class. |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data and methods; restricts direct access. |
| **Abstraction**  | Hides internal implementation, shows only functionality. |
| **Inheritance**  | Enables one class to inherit fields and methods from another. |
| **Polymorphism** | Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. |

## 📐 2. SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **S** - Single Responsibility Principle | A class should have only one reason to change. |
| **O** - Open/Closed Principle | Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. |
| **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. |
| **I** - Interface Segregation Principle | No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. |
| **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle | Depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes. |

## 🎯 4. Design Patterns

Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.

### 🔸 Types of Patterns:

#### 🔹 Creational
- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

#### 🔹 Structural
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

#### 🔹 Behavioral
- **Observer**
- **Strategy**
- **Command**
- **State**
- **Template Method**
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Iterator**

## 🏛️ 5. Architecture Models

Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a software system.

### 🧱 Common Architectural Styles:

| Architecture Style | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Monolithic**     | All components in a single unit. |
| **Layered (N-tier)** | Presentation, business, and data layers. |
| **Client-Server**  | Client makes requests, server responds. |
| **Microservices**  | Application is broken into small, independent services. |
| **Event-Driven**   | Components communicate via events. |
| **Service-Oriented (SOA)** | Services are reusable and loosely coupled. |
| **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** | Separates application into input, processing, and output components. |
